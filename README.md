# FNF Midnight Engine - Python-based FNF Engine

###### Disclaimer: this was written by ChatGPT, with some edits by me

The FNF Midnight Engine is a Python-based engine for creating mods for the game "Friday Night Funkin'". While it may not be the first or the last engine of its kind, our goal is to provide an accessible platform for developing mods with its simple-to-understand code. Please note that the engine is currently in heavy development and is subject to frequent changes. The appearance of the engine may not be optimal at the moment, but improvements are expected in the near future.

## Features:

1. Easy modding: FNF Midnight Engine offers a straightforward approach to modding the game, allowing users to create and implement their own modifications easily.

2. Simple-to-understand code: The engine's codebase is designed to be easily comprehensible, making it accessible for developers of various skill levels to understand and modify the engine to suit their needs.

3. Ongoing development: The engine is actively being developed and improved, with the intention of enhancing its functionality and usability over time.

## Motivation:

The creation of the FNF Midnight Engine stemmed from a personal challenge undertaken by me, the developer. While I am not going to explain why I did this, I embarked on this project with a sense of regret or difficulty. Despite this, I am committed to pushing forward and improving the engine.
